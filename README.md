# AI Diagnosis ATD Scan: Blood & Hormone Health

## 📌 Project Description
AI Diagnosis ATD Scan is a *machine learning-powered health diagnosis app* that predicts the likelihood of *Anemia, Thyroid Disease, and Diabetes* based on user inputs. Built using *Streamlit*, this tool provides a simple yet effective way to analyze medical indicators and assist in early detection.

## ✨ Features
- *Predicts Anemia, Thyroid Disease, and Diabetes* using trained ML models.
- *User-friendly Interface* with a sleek and professional design.
- *Dynamic Input Fields* tailored to each disease.
- *Stylish UI* with a visually appealing theme and background.
- *Help Text for Inputs* to assist users in entering values correctly.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- *Python* (for machine learning and backend processing)
- *Streamlit* (for building the UI)
- *Scikit-learn* (for model training)
- *Joblib* (for saving and loading models)
- *NumPy & Pandas* (for data processing)

## 🛠 Usage Instructions
1. *Launch the app* using Streamlit.
2. *Select the disease* you want to predict from the sidebar.
3. *Enter the required medical details* in the input fields.
4. *Click the Predict button* to get the diagnosis result.
5. The app will display whether the disease is detected or not.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used
